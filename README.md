# RSCH-EdgeSwappingGraph

This was a tool I tried to use in my research, in the end I'm not sure it ever was developed to the point of being useful. The idea is to create a graph that can be "rewired" (See: "Influence of assortativity and degree-preserving rewiring on the spectra of networks", Van Mieghem et al (2010) and "From random to assortative", Xulvi-Brunet and Sokolov (2004)), so that edges are swapped while preserving the degree-sequence, and measurements can be taken.
